LEDS act as indicators in separate states. An LCD prints the state the 'car' is in. The Car consists of the ATmega328, the LEDs,the l293D cjip,2 DC motors and a reset switch aka a handbrake which turns the motors off.
There are separate functions to put the car forward(both motors on LEDs on as headlights),revese(both motors on but rotating other way LEDs flash as headlights),
Left(right motor on as is left LED as indicator which flashes),Right(left motor on as is right LED as indicator which flashes),Stop(no motor on).
